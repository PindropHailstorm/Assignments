Memory Management is the process of storing memory dynamically and freeing it when not in use. Memory allocation can be defined as allocating a block of space in the computer memory to a program.
When the program forgets to release the memory allocated which is no longer needed, it's called a memory leak. This memory leak can be detrimental to the performance of the system as we cannot use the res

Memory allocation can be defined as allocating a block of space in the computer memory to a program.
In Python memory allocation and deallocation method is automatic as the Python developers created a garbage collector for Python so that the user does not have to do manual garbage collection. 

There are 2 parts of memory: Stack Memory and Heap memory. The methods/method calls and the references are stored in stack memory and all the values objects are stored in a private heap.
